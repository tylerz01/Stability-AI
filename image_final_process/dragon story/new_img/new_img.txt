A timid dragon gazes up at the starry night sky in a magical forest, surrounded by towering trees that touch the clouds.
A little mouse sneezes loudly, startling the dragon resting under an oak tree, prompting the dragon to investigate the source of the sound.
The dragon and the mouse meet for the first time, with the mouse introducing himself while sniffling from dust.
The dragon and the mouse share laughter and stories as they explore the forest together, building a newfound friendship.
The mouse demonstrates the importance of washing hands by splashing in a sparkling stream, showing the dragon how fun it can be.
The dragon joyfully dips his claws in the water, feeling the cool sensation ripple through his scales as he embraces the playful moment.
As the sun sets, the dragon realizes he no longer fears being different, feeling brave and excited for future adventures with his friend.
